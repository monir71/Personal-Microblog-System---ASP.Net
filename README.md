Microblogging is an online broadcast medium that exists as a specific form of blogging. A micro-blog differs from a traditional blog in that its content is typically smaller in both actual and aggregated file size. Micro-blogs "allow users to exchange small elements of content such as short sentences, individual images, or video links", which may be the major reason for their popularity. These small messages are sometimes called micro posts.   As with traditional Blogging, micro-bloggers post about topics ranging from the simple, such as "what I'm doing right now", to the thematic, such as "sports cars". Commercial micro-blogs also exist to promote websites, services, and products and to promote collaboration within an organization. Some microblogging services offer privacy settings, which allow users to control who can read their microblogs or alternative ways of publishing entries besides the web-based interface. These may include text messaging, instant messaging, E-mail, digital audio or digital video.
